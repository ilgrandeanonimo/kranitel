    do-not-reload: <red><bold>Warning!</bold></red><white>You should not perform a
        server reload with /reload confirm. If you need to reload plugin messages or
        configuration, it's better to use the appropriate command that most plugins provide
        (usually /<plugin> reload). Otherwise, restart the server.
